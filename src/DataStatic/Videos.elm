On many fronts Elm has been a huge success: it’s been popular with new and seasoned programmers alike; it’s helped push several language ideas into the mainstream; it’s been a key part of several successful software businesses and he even found himself employed as a kind of Language Designer in Residence. And yet, the material rewards of a successful open-source project were…lacking. Was he naive? Can an open-source developer stay true to open-source principles and still make a decent living? Is open source being exploited by commercial software businesses? These topics and more tumble out of what has to be the first question in the podcast: What’s happening with Elm?"

If we think of a picture not as a collection of colored pixels but rather as a function from a bounding rectangle to a rendering, we can define very simple yet powerful picture combinators that allow us accomplish our task with ease and elegance.

Using Horizon in your Elm app can help alleviate the pain by reducing the amount of work you have to do in the back-end, so you can write more Elm code.\nWhen starting a new project in JavaScript, you’re most likely going to spend a lot of time choosing the tools and frameworks to use, and then spend more time configuring them. Elm pretty much solves this problem by providing all the tooling you need out of the box, and by The Elm Community’s preference to have one way to do things, so you don’t have choose between 100 different packages just to solve 1 problem.\nBut, how about the back-end? You still have to choose all the stacks; from database, web server, programming language, and the framework. At least, until we have server side Elm, we still have the same problem here.\nWouldn’t it be great if you don’t have to worry about the back-end, and can just focus on writing Elm code and be happy? We can do that with Horizon. Horizon is an open source server designed for building real time application without writing any back-end code.

We benefit from the bountiful attention that painters, designers, physicists, biologists, doctors, mathematicians, makeup artists, and so many others have paid to studying color and its perception. Within our field as software engineers, we can be confident in the strengths of the color spaces we've defined, like RGB and HSL. However, we may also find that these color spaces, while they perfectly describe how we want our colors to render, don't actually reflect what we want our users to see. In this talk, we'll turn our gaze towards our users' perception of colors: how can we make palette choices that work for our users? My hope is that you leave this talk feeling excited about colors, and maybe even like your attitude toward them just slipped on a pair of rosy glasses."

It's okay to ask basic questions, to make mistakes and take a break from GitHub once a while. These values are much more present in the Elm community than any other programming community I've been a part of.\nIt all starts with the language design itself, with difficult syntax and concepts being phased out each release. The compiler errors are incredibly human, and so are the messages you get for trying to install not-yet-updated packages. But this goes far beyond the command line messages. People discuss ideas on the super friendly Elm Slack. Beginners' problems are solved in a respectful way, welcoming and including them in the community.\nThe way packages are versioned helps alleviate the pains of breaking changes both for the users and the authors. When a competing package comes around, people involved in the more mature package applaud the effort and share their knowledge.\nAll this means the Elm community is nice for people, which is crucial, and that it is also great for the package ecosystem as a whole.

Why is it then, that when I am working on an Elm app, I find myself flipping back and forth from tab to tab and scrolling through the hundreds of lines of code trying to find a few lines I've already read? While we may be able to hold vast amount of data in our brains, this does not apply to our \"working memory\". As programmers, we have to be picky about what we dive into within a codebase. This is why naming in Elm, though often taken for granted as styling choices, becomes an integral part of working memory preservation. Reducing the amount of names we have to parse, or making those names more expected, can lower the number of assumptions we have to make and the space we need in our memory to hold them. I hope to introduce some small stylistic changes as well as grander design approach suggestions, so that people can write their Elm apps with greater confidence and velocity."

Yes, it works, and surprisingly, it is much more versatile and makes for great separation of concerns.\nThis talk will look at the conceptual differences and implications, touch on some of the big-ticket technical refactors necessary to make the switch, and explore some fun and interesting demos that would not have been possible before."

Elm pretty much solves this problem by providing all the tooling you need out of the box, and by The Elm Community’s preference to have one way to do things, so you don’t have choose between 100 different packages just to solve 1 problem.\nBut, how about the back-end?

The games it makes would be less about modeling spacial navigation and branching narratives over time, and more about modeling a story that unfolds like a puzzle, like a cross between a traditional novel and a point-and-click adventure. The design goals include a clean and simple way to author stories as a developer, and a simple interaction style for players, keeping the focus squarely on the text-based narrative.\nThis talk looks briefly at some of existing options in this area, such as Inform 7 for writing text adventures, RenPy for making visual novels, and Twine for “non-linear hypertext narratives,” comparing and contrasting their approaches to the Elm Narrative Engine.\nAfter a demo of a fully-featured story written on the Elm Narrative Engine, I will dive into the code and the technical considerations and challenges faced in approaching building the engine with Elm. I will give a lot of attention to the differences of building a framework in Elm, as opposed to an app or library and the challenges this brings, including these topics:\nHow The Elm Architecture applies to designing a framework\nTreating the engine as a “run time” and the client as an “embedded app”\nHow to make use of types to build a clean client “api”\nData structures and state-machines for narrative data and internationalization consideration\nUsing the “time traveling debugger” technique for “rewinding” narrative branches\nUsing Elm’s Commands for adding multi-media to a story\nBy the end of the talk, the audience should have a good appreciation for the technical and design decisions in interactive storytelling, and a concrete grasp on designing a framework in Elm and how to define the boundaries between client and framework code.

      , description = "Everyone knows that writing concurrent systems is difficult. The trouble is that nearly all programs are accidentally concurrent!\nSure, you do not use locks or semaphores. But are you are using the event loop in JavaScript? Are you mutating any local state? Do you use objects? Do you have dynamic event streams? This talk will reframe these extraordinarily common patterns as concurrent systems. This reframing is a shockingly powerful way of understand \"accidental complexity\" in your code base. It often reveals a truly insane concurrent system that no benevolent coder would knowingly design.\nThis talk will start by exploring \"message-passing concurrency\" as a foundation. This is very sane approach to concurrency as seen in Concurrent ML, Go, and Clojure. With this foundation, we will go through some seemingly simple examples and tease out the underlying concurrent system. The goal of this talk is for you to walk away being able to recognize concurrency and use this reframing to avoid \"accidental complexity\" as much as possible. Message-passing concurrency is also the foundation of interactivity in Elm as well, so we will also see how Elm guides you towards using concurrency appropriately in your front-end code without you even thinking about it.\nThese ideas should be applicable in nearly every code base you see, and this perspective should help you write better code whether you are writing JavaScript or Elm or anything else!"
