There are lots of learning materials for Elm, but sometimes it's hard to find them, or know which one is right for you.

Here's our guide to help you on your way!

## References

- [Elm Cookbook](https://orasund.gitbook.io/elm-cookbook/) - Jeremy Fairbank, the author of the Book Programming Elm, noticed that there is no Elm cookbook, that would serve as a follow-up to a beginners book. This book aims to fill this empty spot.
- [Elm Types Glossary](https://gist.github.com/JoelQ/6b303d9ad450537163b6f8f6cf8a4ed8) - There's a lot of type terminology and jargon going around when discussing types in Elm. This glossary attempts to list some of the most common type terms along with synonyms, terms from other language communities, examples, and links to more detailed articles on each topic.
