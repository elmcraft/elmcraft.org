Nope! The Elm community is alive and kicking. See for yourself below.

Note: this is a common question for Elm, see [why](#why-is-this-question-frequent?).


## Elm in production

Here are some experience reports from companies using Elm in production:

- [Elm at Rakuten](https://engineering.rakuten.today/post/elm-at-rakuten/)
- [Elm at NoRedInk](https://juliu.is/elm-at-noredink/)
- [Elm at Humio](https://www.humio.com/whats-new/blog/why-we-chose-elm-for-humio-s-web-ui)
- [Elm at Microsoft](https://elmtown.simplecast.com/episodes/it-just-goes-on-and-on-x_tpWljQ)
- [Elm at Gizra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgaoOgJ5CAU)
- [Elm at Ford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WVXCy1Q88o)

- [Elm at other companies](https://github.com/jah2488/elm-companies#readme)


## Elm community

Elm has a active and vibrant community, with over 20,000 members on Slack, an active Discourse site and a number of other Discord servers, see the full [Elm Forums/Chat](/community/forums-chat) page for details.

There are also [Meetups](/community) and [Conferences](/community/conferences), though less active due to Covid same as everyone.

## Elm Core

Elm's core release cycle works in batches, so a lack of frequent updates is not an indicator of inactivity.


## Elm Packages

Elm has a lot of [packages](https://package.elm-lang.org/) with a strong community philosophy of deeply thought out APIs and great documentation.

Check out a list of recent package updates at [https://elm-greenwood.com/](https://elm-greenwood.com/).


## Elm Ecosystem

There are many active and excited contributors to the Elm ecosystem.

Here are some of the more ambitious and highly active projects:

- [elm-pages](https://elm-pages.com/) by Dillon
- [elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/) by Matthew
- [elm-spa](https://www.elm-spa.dev/) by Ryan
- [elm-review](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/jfmengels/elm-review/latest/) by Jeroen
- [Elm Language Server](https://github.com/elm-tooling/elm-language-server) by Kolja
- [ren lang](https://ren-lang.github.io/) by Hayleigh

## Why is this question frequent?

There are a number of reasons, but in brief;

- Success in Elm is not measured in popularity or Github activity.
  - Elm's core release cycle works in batches, so a lack of frequent updates is not an indicator of inactivity.
- Sometimes folks coming from JavaScript or other languages bring across these expectations and then ask questions when they don't see the same indicators in the Elm ecosystem.

- Elm's core development is not done by committee, but by trust.
- Elm's [design philosophy](/todo) means certain things aren't available by design (like inline JS FFI from Elm).
- These differences and the recurring questions have created a fatigue in the Elm community over the years:

> Honestly I think the main reason for this perception is that people in the Elm community have gotten increasingly tired of correcting inaccuracies people like to post about Elm on Hacker News.
>
> I spent a bunch of time doing that in the past, and eventually stopped because I felt like Sisyphus. The same people would crop up on the next thread repeating the same things anyway. Of course if the claims go unchallenged, it leads to the perception that they're accurate...but that doesn't make engaging with them any more enjoyable a way to spend one's free time.
>
> If you want to check the health of the Elm community, visit [Elm Slack](/community/forums-chat) and ask in the #beginners channel how people feel about it. It takes about the same amount of time as posting a HN comment, but it gives a very different perspective than the one you'd get if your main source of Elm information was Hacker News comments! :)
