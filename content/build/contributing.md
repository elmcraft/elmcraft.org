### How to contribute to Elm

Here are the ways to contribute from simplest to most involved:


#### Packages

This is where most people start out. Anyone can [Build a package for Elm](TODO).

You might also be interested in a [Guided tour of popular Elm packages](TODO).


#### Tooling

There are lots of contributors who have built [Tools for Elm](/build/tooling).

- Tools for Elm (elm-format, elm-test, elm-review, etc)
- Tools that expand Elm (i.e. elm-pages, elm-spa, etc)


#### Core development

Elm core development works differently to most open source.

This approach is a big part of why Elm is the way it is today, and how a number of delightful features unique to Elm came to be.
